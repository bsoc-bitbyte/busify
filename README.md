# Busify-Ticket Booking System ðŸšŒ

A centralised bus ticket booking system that will allow the students to book tickets in advance through an online website, saving time and effort. Students will no longer need to physically stand in long queues to purchase tickets.

The ticket booking system will provide a user-friendly interface where passengers can search for available routes, select their desired travel date and time and make secure online payments.

- Provides authentication
- Authenticate using college email IDs,
- QR code scanner,
- A list of booked tickets.
- Generates QR codes for confirmed tickets,
